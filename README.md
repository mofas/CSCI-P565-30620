# Software Engineering


## Prerequisite

#### Node.js

Please install node.js server from https://nodejs.org/en/.

After you installed, make sure it can be invoked from your command line tools.

Please input `node -v` on to see if it can report version of your node.js.

```
$ node -v
v8.4.0
```

#### Yarn

Please install Yarn from https://yarnpkg.com/en/.

After you installed, make sure it can be invoked from your command line tools.

Please input `yarn -v` to see if it can report version of your yarn.

```
$ yarn -v
1.0.1
```

## IDE / Tools

I will suggest use VS code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), sublime text (https://www.sublimetext.com/) or Atom (https://atom.io/) for developing.

Those IDE can improve your productivity significantly.
